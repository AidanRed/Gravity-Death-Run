Add different types of guns.
 - flamethrower
 - rocket launcher (can destroy terrain, gravity acts as 'guidance' system)
 - machine gun
 - laser rifle (gravity does not affect it)
 - cannon (slow-moving, is not affected by gravity, can destroy terrain)

Add different types of terrain (different types will be vulnerable to different weapons).
 - wood (vulnerable to flamethrower)
